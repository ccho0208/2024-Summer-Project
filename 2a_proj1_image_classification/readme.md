# Image Classification using CNNs

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop and implement a robust image classification pipeline using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

## Methods
The project leverages state-of-the-art CNN architectures, including:

1. **VGG (Visual Geometry Group Network):**
   - Known for its simplicity and depth, VGG uses small 3x3 filters and has a straightforward, uniform architecture. This project explores the VGG-16 and VGG-19 variants, which consist of 16 and 19 layers, respectively.
   
2. **ResNet (Residual Network):**
   - Introduced by Microsoft Research, ResNet addresses the vanishing gradient problem by using skip connections or residuals. This allows the network to learn identity functions, making it possible to train very deep networks (e.g., ResNet-50, ResNet-101).
   
3. **GoogLeNet (Inception Network):**
   - Developed by Google, this architecture incorporates Inception modules that allow the network to capture multi-scale features by using multiple filters of different sizes in parallel. The project utilizes the Inception-v1 (GoogLeNet) variant.

## Pipeline
The image classification pipeline involves several key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Loading and normalizing CIFAR-10 images.
   - Data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, flipping, and rotation to improve model generalization.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Implementing and training VGG, ResNet, and GoogLeNet architectures using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
   - Fine-tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and optimizer settings.
   - Employing techniques like learning rate scheduling and early stopping to optimize training.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluating model performance on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Comparing the performance of different architectures to determine the most effective model for CIFAR-10 classification.

4. **Model Deployment:**
   - Exporting the trained models for deployment in real-world applications.
   - Creating a user-friendly interface or API for image classification predictions.

## Challenges
- Managing the computational complexity and training time for deep networks.
- Preventing overfitting, especially with a relatively small dataset like CIFAR-10.
- Ensuring the models are scalable and efficient for deployment.

## Outcome
The project aims to achieve high accuracy in classifying CIFAR-10 images, demonstrating the effectiveness of CNN architectures in image recognition tasks. It also provides insights into the strengths and limitations of each CNN model, contributing to the broader field of computer vision.
